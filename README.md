Because I have issue in connecting the github/gists api, so I create a basic CRUD api with Express + MongoDB.

The Front End Application is built up with 

#####React
#####Redux
#####Material-ui

## Installation

Go to client folder and run 

```bash
npm install
```

Then run
```bash
npm run start
```

## API

The API will be my heroku api, I will be enable this api to any ip for Friday (Feb. 6th) and Monday (Feb. 8th)
